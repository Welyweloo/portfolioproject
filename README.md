# Portfolio Project

My portfolio has been created to display the different projects I worked on at school or personnally to train myself.

Below I listed almost everything I used to create this website:
- HTML, CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- PHP
- Composer (Altorouter)

Below I listed what I need to work on still:
- Safari doesn't handle the gifs opacity
- The icons are slowing the page loading so does one of the fonts
- Adding a form to receive comments from people
